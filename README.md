# VAT Registration Portal - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend for the **VAT Registration System**! This web application provides a user-friendly interface for managing Value Added Tax (VAT) registrations, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), and modern development practices.

## Project Overview

This project serves as the robust and intuitive frontend component of a comprehensive VAT Registration Portal. It aims to modernize and streamline the traditional, often paper-based, VAT registration process by transforming it into a digital, user-friendly, and efficient experience for businesses.
Key functionalities include:

* **Guided Multi-Step Registration:** Users are guided through a series of forms (Part A, Part B, Part C, Bank Info, Additional Business Places, Partner Details, Document Upload) to ensure all necessary information is captured systematically and accurately. 
* **Secure Document Submission:** Facilitates the upload and management of essential supporting documents required for VAT registration. 
* **User Authentication & Session Management:** Manages secure login, password recovery, and persistent user sessions using JWT tokens.
* **Real-time Validation:** Implements client-side validation at each step to ensure data accuracy and reduce errors before submission.
* **Responsive and Intuitive UI:** Delivers a consistent, accessible, and responsive user interface designed with Bootstrap 5.
