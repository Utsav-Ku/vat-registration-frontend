# VAT Registration Portal - Frontend

This is the frontend of the **VAT Registration System**, built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). It provides a user-friendly interface for managing VAT registrations, interacting with backend APIs to handle users and data.

This project is a work-in-progress with the following pages created:

### Completed Pages

- *Sign In Page*
- *Forgot Id*
- *Forgot Password*
- *Home page*
- *Part A Form*
- *Document Upload*
- *Finish Page*

The routing between the above pages is managed through **React Router**, enabling smooth navigation without full page reloads. Each form page maintains its state during navigation, ensuring a seamless user experience throughout the VAT registration process.

We plan to develop the remaining pages and integrate APIs to enable real-time data flow and full backend connectivity.

### UI/UX Notes

- Based on [VAT-frontend-wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/cLaFvjaWHnxJeGCE9S2qW4/VAT?node-id=0-1&t=GH5D5sxhzYbzXiyp-1)
- Consistent Bootstrap 5-based design


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
